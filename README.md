The present repository encompasses a COVID-19 classification model that was developed based on CT scans of the lungs obtained from real patients treated in hospitals across Saudi Arabia. It is noteworthy that the dataset utilized for this study is proprietary and cannot be publicly shared. The classification of the CT scan images as either COVID-19 positive or negative was performed through transfer learning. The developed models achieved an outstanding accuracy of 99.1%, and the utilized architecture types were Densenet121, ResNet50, and VGG19.
